A Dijkstra's Algorithm based on Coursera course: C++ for C programmers.

## Organisation

This file is organised in the followin manner:

* **build**: This folder contains all objects and their dependencies, and the `executable file`.
* **IraPohlCourseLibrary**: Library created to support graph based shortest path algorithm (also included in library).
* **src**: Contains the `main` file where the main logic is implemented.

## Working mode
Develop the desired logic in `main` file and compile it (`make`) in **build** folder. Afterwards, run the executable on a terminal to see the results.

**WARNING**: DO NOT CHANGE FILES/FOLDERS DISPOSITIONS, OTHERWISE IT WILL NOT COMPILE!
